Description: PyModels
        ========
        
        `PyModels` is a lightweight framework for mapping Python classes to schema-less
        databases. It is not an ORM as it doesn't map existing schemata to Python
        objects but instead defines them on a higher layer built upon a schema-less
        storage (key/value or document-oriented). You define models as a valuable subset
        of the whole database and work with only certain parts of existing entities --
        the parts you need.
